## Code Description:

The program consists of a single Java class, `MainQ2`, containing the main method and a utility method for displaying the middle characters.

- **`MainQ2.java`**: The main class that takes user input and invokes the method to display the middle characters.
  
- **`displayTheMiddleCharacter(String enteredString)`**: A utility method that calculates and prints the middle character(s) of the given string. It accounts for both even and odd-length strings.

## Sample Usage:

```java
Enter the string to get middle characters: Hello
This is the middle character: l
